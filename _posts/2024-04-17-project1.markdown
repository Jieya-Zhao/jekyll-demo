### Overview

In this lab I showcase my basic understanding of html and CSS skills learned from a timespan of 1 week. In this lab, I explored firstly building the html structure from stratch and then further organize the layout using CSS.

### Highlights

- Functional hamburger menu bar with drawer menu achieved by pure CSS
- Interative CSS animations
